# Example Ground Control Points File (CSV)
# Format: id,image_x,image_y,geo_x,geo_y,epsg_code
# image_x, image_y: pixel coordinates (column, row from top-left)
# geo_x, geo_y: geographic coordinates (e.g., longitude, latitude or easting, northing)
# epsg_code: EPSG code of the geographic coordinates (e.g., 4326 for WGS84 Lon/Lat)
# This is a placeholder for actual georeferencing data.
# For the georeference_map function to be more than a placeholder,
# it would need to parse these points and use them in a transformation.
